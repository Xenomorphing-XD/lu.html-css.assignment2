Here's an example of how to create a parent div with 4 child divs in a single row using flexbox.

Explanation:

First, we create a div element with the class parent to act as the parent container for the child divs. We then create four child divs with the class child inside the parent div.

Next, we use CSS to style the parent div with display: flex; to create a flex container. This allows us to use the power of flexbox to control the layout of the child elements.

We set flex-wrap: nowrap; to ensure that all child elements remain in a single row, even if the screen width is not wide enough to accommodate them all.

We then style the child divs with flex: 1; to distribute available space evenly among the child elements. This means that each child element will take up an equal amount of space within the parent div.

To add some spacing between child elements, we set margin-right: 10px; on each child element, except for the last child element, which we select using the :last-child pseudo-class and remove the margin using margin-right: 0;.

Finally, we add a background color and height to the child divs to make them visible on the screen.

That's it! With this code, you'll have a parent div with 4 child divs in a single row using flexbox.
